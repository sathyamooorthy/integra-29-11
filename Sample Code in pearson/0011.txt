The code below asks the user “Do you want to repeat the program or quit? (R/Q)”. A loop should repeat until the user has entered an R or Q (either uppercase or lowercase). Replace the second line with the appropriate while statement.



again = input('Do you want to repeat ' + 'the program or quit? (R/Q) ')

# What goes here?

again = input('Do you want to repeat the ' + 'program or quit? (R/Q) ')

while again.upper() != 'R' and again.upper() != 'Q':
